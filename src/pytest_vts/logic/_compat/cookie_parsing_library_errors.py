"""This particular compatibility module deals with various libraries
difficulties of parsing certain Set-Cookie header values, such as:
  - 'Expires=Fri, 24 Feb 2017 00:58:28 GMT'

The purpose of this compabitility module is to allow pytest-vts to work with
any version of responses (which mightbe locked in by other dependency.). For
now I prefer this solution to vendoring responses entirely.

`responses` library has been using various libraries for parsing the Set-Cookie
header value.
  1. `responses <0.10.0` used cookies library
  2. `responses ==0.10.0,==0.10.1` used biscuits library
  3. `responses >=0.10.2` has been using http.cookies (for python3) and cookie
      for (python2)

Note: since it's quite hard to actually detect what cookie parsing library is used by responses
  - older releases didn't extracted the cookie parsing code in it's own method.
or to dynamically detect the installed version of responses:
  - pkg_resources has been known to fail detecting the version of the installed
    package on some ocasions assumptions are made by the following code. The
first library successfully loaded will be the one assumed to be used by
responses. This approach might fail in complex virtualenvs with multiple cookie
parsing libraries installed, but should cover most common cases.
